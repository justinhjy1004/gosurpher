Imagine being trapped in a room where you have a babbling fool of a professor in some business school who notably has no experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. Yet, because of ChatGPT, they decide to write about generative AI.

What is the probability of you hearing the word \textit{AI} given the rate at which she blurts \textit{AI} at a rate of $\lambda$?

This seems like a difficult task, but we can use the Poisson distribution to resolve this question. We can interpret $\lambda$ as the rate of occurrence, such that this professor uses the word excitedly. Even though all bad things must come to an end, often from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM on Friday evenings, Poisson is a good approximation based on the Poisson Paradigm.

\section*{Poisson Paradigm}
The Poisson Paradigm states:

\begin{quote}
Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be events with probabilities $p(A_i)$ where $p(A_i)$ are small, and $A_j$ are either independent or weakly dependent. Then, let
\[
I(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n I(A_i)
\]
where $I(A_i)$ indicates if $A_i$ occurred. Then $I(A)$ is approximately Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda$.
\end{quote}

In this context, we have the word \textit{AI} in a given meeting be $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ and $p(A_i) = p(A_j)$ where $p(A_i)$ means the word $A_i$ is \textit{AI}.

Assuming weak dependence, which understandably is a point of contention, the number of times you hear the word \textit{AI} is approximately Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda = n \cdot p$.

\section*{Probability Mass Function of the Poisson Distribution}
Let $X \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)$ and $k$ is the number of occurrences, then

\[
\Pr(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\]
