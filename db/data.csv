It is an essence in us that we are so willing to forget given the optimizing goal of consuming more, which means producing more, though not in a better way. As a result we have created a society that aims to squeeze the very last bit of human effort in the name of producing more, for the sake of consumption.
		As of writing, I left one of the most painful experiences in life. A huge part of it lies in my warped perception of the value of work (or rather the lack thereof) in the situation I was in, and I didn't believe in a bit the things I produced. Harvard Business School has a knack for getting professors of the lowest quality perhaps, though as Aiqi said, it could be a selection bias issue. Afterall, who would truly go to a business school academia unless you truly do not care deep down about discovering life's most interesting questions (Sorry Julian, you are honestly one of the good ones). But I dare say that though the publication records of these professors might be great on paper, the papers they produce are abhorrently bad and sad. I shall not generalize to Harvard as an institution as a whole, since I had read many great works by Harvard researchers, though it does paint a very somber picture to me the state of research in the world.
		Of course, every where has bullshit problems. But reflecting on that experience really shaped how I feel about work, for better or worse. I no longer hold research as a sacred work that the most intelligent of us partake in. No. It is after all a form of business. However, I do recognize the good that can come from good research. The ones that are worthwhile. The ones that I know is going to matter to people living in this world, and not the constant stream of 'AI this' or 'AI that'. The farcical nature of research that one can find here makes me think that we should have a collective effort to humble the worst of the offenders. 
		Yet they sit on the ivory tower. I wish I was not as intelligent as they are, and I wish that I have learned something that matters here in this place, but I cannot say that unfortunately. What I can say is that it opened up my mind to what is worthwhile doing, work that matters. Work that changes lives for the better, and that truly comes from the passion to obtain knowledge and to know. I don't want to be a manager of sorts, getting RAs in line to do all of my painful work. I want to do that work, the pain, the headaches and all. And most importantly, research that matters to the world, that I can look back proudly and say, I did my research on that.",generic/personal/joy-of-good-work,Personal

One that perhaps was way better than his life, performing precise operations that do not truly benefit anyone in the long run, except to line the pockets of the medical industry. This broke him. It was not drama. It was not personal vendetta. It was just cold-hearted cash grabs that destroyed his soul.
Jonathan sent me that video soon after I left Jackie's team. However, a part of me still feels stuck. I do know that quitting does not equal to a resolution, that I am aware of. What I am saddened is the partial clarity of the pointlessness of my work. Rebecca (my counselor) summarized it up so well, noting that this is a crisis, an existential one. I exercised my agency to walk away once. I think I can do it again. Though I recognize the importance of this transition of my life, I recognize that I cannot do my PhD with good conscience in an institution like Harvard Business School. 
That is in my control. All of that concern is in my control. To pursue my PhD in an institution, and do research in a field that I like, that is in my control. Of course, having a fulfilling worklife is indeed a privilege, and I recognize that. But since this is a choice thrusted upon me, I do have to ask, should I take the route of vestige of prestige? Probably not. My agency is truly tested when I am given this difficult choice, a difficult choice to choose between the 'natural' path or otherwise. All of the ideas of success instilled in us since childhood appear so fickle now in my head, and maybe what Brent said is true. It is indeed liberating to come to that realization.
As for working with Julian, time would tell. The only thing that I really have to answer to is my love for Nathan. I am of course not putting this responsibility on you Nathan, I don't. Noting that this is just a transitory period is what I need to keep in mind. Noting that my decisions are shocking to folks that think it is crazy to walk away makes me happy, just a little, in the inside. Noting that life is totally out of control, but it is fine to admit that, and only assume the parts that are within your agency simultaneously makes you feel small and weak, but you are on firm ground, Justin. 
Good luck!",generic/personal/agency-and-our-choice-to-live,Personal
4,"2024-08-08 19:23:47","My Thoughts on AI (Because Of Course!)","Justin Ho","I am probably too late for the AI dunking party since the stock market is treating tech companies pretty poorly as I am writing, but I do think that even at this moment, there are so many people who are still on the hype train. With a knack of being bad in predictions, I think that the AI hype will end soon enough (and God do I hope it does!) but I am just sitting here, listening to this random guy behind me talking about (prompt engineering, https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=CS587847) and how cool it is. And it is! It is truly marvelous that us nerds have found a way to create something that is willing to hold a conversations with us! But I do not think that it is the miracle that some claim it to be.
	In all honesty, my negative views of AI probably came from work. Constantly being surrounded by AI hypers who do not know a single thing about AI, Machine Learning, or basic technology, it is difficult to not feel like I am drowning. I have been told 'Have you tried ChatGPT?' enough times that I might do what (Lucidity, https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/) would do to you if you mention AI again. However, I am just not quite ready to be homicidal.
	I think fundamentally, AI would not yet be the amorphous 'AGI'. I do not think that we have reached a point where we have discovered how to algorithmically replicate human intelligence. In fact, my position is not that controversial. Meta's AI Chief Scientist (Yann LeCun, https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-meta-yann-lecun-interview/) agrees with me on this point. Though I do think that we have created a very different and novel kind of intelligence with the recent advancements of LLMs. I do want, in all honesty and sincerity, that this hype will die down soon, and we can see AI for what it truly is. Appreciate its wonders but recognize its failures. Try not to be too much like an Asian parent and expect groundbreaking things from AI, and that is okay. And maybe with all of that, I can start enjoying AI again.",generic/personal/my-thoughts-on-ai,Personal
5,"2024-08-11 13:18:51","The Only Hacking I am Doing is P-Hacking","Justin Ho","There often comes a time when you realize that the work that you are doing is bullshit. Mine came when my dear professor asked me to 'Take a deeper look into it!' when her main experiment's hypothesis never quite panned out. Of course, nobody knew beforehand what would have happened in the experiment. I would never profess to have such an ability to predict the unknown. All I heard from that command is of course to p-hack the shit out of the dataset to find a gem, whatever it is. 
For any reader that is unaware of what p-hacking is, it is basically the act of sifting through the data, slicing, cleaning, manipulating it, and conduct various statistical tests in hopes of a few of them being statistically significant. A primer can be found here from the (Embassy of Good Science,https://embassy.science/wiki/Theme:6b584d4e-2c9d-4e27-b370-5fbdb983ab46). You might say, isn't that normal to do so? And if statistics is worth anything, it is a tool to prove your hypotheses, right? You my friend, should consider being a business school professor, as you are teeming with the right kind of optimism in such a place. Andrew Gelman wrote a great paper talking about p-hacking in social science in this (article, http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) for those who are interested in the misleading nature of research driven by p-hacking.
I have just gotten interested in cybersecurity. Learning about lower level programming which I used to abhor. Yet now the only hacking that I get to do is p-hacking. I would not call such a practice fraud. It is not. I think many well meaning people find themselves rethinking their hypotheses from initial studies. But coming from professors who should know better, it is deeply troubling, it is deeply unsettling. The (Center of Open Science, https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) as well as the (Wharton Credibility Lab, https://aspredicted.org/) set up ways to combat such practices called (pre-registrations, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)). Yet I see multiple professors constantly flouting such rules in the 'top' research institutions in the United States. A few examples of such practices are not publishing pre-registrations that 'failed' to pan out, pre-registring bullshit with very vague hypotheses and goals to only later claim that they have followed the pre-registered analyses, and some even just straight up send folks to dead links. The Data Colada team does provide an article describing how to (pre-register your studies properly, https://datacolada.org/64). 
In any sense, I wish that this practice will wither and die out. We need to really change the culture of research. I am honestly coming from a place of selfishness. I see how these practices crushed my soul (and still crushing it as an RA), but I don't yet see a way out. If anything, things might get worse before it gets better",generic/statistically-speaking/only-p-hacking,"Statistically Speaking"

In this spirit, I begin with the Poisson Distribuion.",poisson,"Stories of Distribution"
7,"2024-08-20 17:41:51","The Exponential Distribution","Justin Ho","In the second distribution in this series, I'd like to explore the Exponential distribution, which is closely related to the Poisson. In many ways, it is a perspective change, but we can build on this change to explore the ways in which how the Exponential distribution and the Poisson jointly form what we call as the Poisson Process.",exponential,"Stories of Distribution"
8,"2024-08-20 17:47:27","The Gamma Distribution","Justin Ho","The Gamma distribution has always fascinated me, mostly because it is a less commonly used Greek alphabet, and the PDF somehow has a Gamma function nested within it, which makes it terrifying. This is true with the Beta as well, but it just lacks that mysterious vibe. It is also extremely important since it is related a number of important distributions, but I'd like to focus on its connections to the Exponential and the Poisson.",gamma,"Stories of Distribution"
9,"2024-08-23 14:42:19","Denying Delusions","Justin Ho","The occasional clarity that I have as I see sunlight peer through the leaves. I can see them glistening and momentarily waving at me as I walk towards them. I don't have the luxury of enjoying such clear vision, especially at night. To correct myself, I don't have such a privilege whilst maintaining my desire to not wear my thick corrective lenses. I have no problems with glasses, just not the weary ones I have.
Sitting outdoors at the SEAS building, I could not help but wonder if engineers really care about the greeneries that surround them. I don't see them often outside and that makes sense. I don't see many people in the summer in that respect. What a pity, I think, where many in lower Allston could enjoy such tranquility that Harvard could afford, yet to them without an access card it seems like an impenetrable forest. A forest that even I, a cardholder, sometimes hesitate for the sole reason that I do not belong. The irony of it all is that Harvard has an open campus, the degree of which is obviously debatable.
Momentary clarity helps me as I have come to accept the many beautiful delusions I enjoy having. They are fundamentally delusions, yet I have to cling onto them. In darkness, they creep and they wrap me around with the warm touch of what I think this world is about. They comfort me until they don't. But they are parts of me that give me hope and despair, if not an illusory imagination that I am contorted with.
Maybe I should not see this world that clearly and thank God for my astigmatism. It helps to just have this distorted lens that tells you that the world is conspiring for you and humbling you that not all you see is real.",generic/personal/denying-delusions,personal
