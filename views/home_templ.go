For the longest time in my life, I have always seen code from a purely utilitarian fashion. People said, learn Python or R, since I was really interested in breaking into the field of Data Science, and in many ways I have. To my disappointment, that failed to quell my need to learn and experience something new. I have an innate desire to build, to relearn what has been learnt from a new perspective, and thanks to Dr. Mann, who suggested this great language to me, I have been pleasantly surprised by the process of learning, and programming as an expression of myself.</p><p class=\"mb-4 font-medium\">The classic trope of the blog website as your portfolio is not lost on me. This serves in some ways as a portfolio, yes, but it is also a website that I am building to reconnect with something painfully lost in our modern web. Content is now served to us, with social media at the forefront of this phenomenon that I think radically changed how we think and how we interact withthe internet. In a very sad twist, it is unfortunately not the case where one seeks to explore to web, but rather fed with with a stack of content, curated to grab the most attention, and plated by an all elusive algorithm that shapes our society. I want the internet to go back to its 'web' like behaviours, where humans had the agency to explore instead of being governed by rabbithole creating algorithms. I understand the appeal, and how great these algorithms can be. But something is fundamentally lost, when we stop active searching, but passively consuming content.</p><p class=\"mb-4 font-light\">And yes, credits to Maggie Appleton, this my homebaked software. GoSurpher, I hope, embodies the exploratory nature of the internet, as I write down the great things I have explored in my life, be it the 'real world' that I occupy, or mathematical fantastical ideas that I hope to share to the world. I hope this to be crude and creative, as I have learned from my experience in the shiniest place in the academic world, that not all that glitters is gold.</p><a href=\"blog\" class=\"inline-flex items-center font-medium text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-800 dark:text-primary-500 dark:hover:text-primary-700\">My Blog <svg class=\"ml-1 w-6 h-6\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a></div></div></section></div>")
